# Coding Challenge 34 - Date Night
**Build your own version of the below game and add the fun(challenging) CSS animations:**

Last month, I discovered something fun: https://www.datenightquestions.com/

If you click on the above link, you will see that this website has a card animation to drag and flip the questions (cards). In this challenge we are going to try and recreate this effect on our own projects!


## The Rules Are:

1. You will need to create a deck of cards, then make the cards "flip" when you drag and drop. You should be able to achieve this effect with many types of JS libraries (or even pure CSS). The challenge is to use google and figure out how you can do it on your own. Good luck!

2. Use whatever tools you have as developers (google, friends, Discord, programming buddy etc...) but I will not be offering any help with this challenge. Just like a developer, you must solve a problem and create something unique. Nobody will hold your hand during the job so we want to experience that by figuring it all out on your own with your team. 


## Submissions:

Student Submissions will be posted here at the end of the challenge:
